Recent progress in computer vision proves that large generative models can model natural images with a decent quality
([BigGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.11096.pdf),
[GLOW](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.03039v2.pdf), etc).
Nevertheless, there are still vast room to improve the generalization ability, the generation process, and the community is keen to learn new 
approaches for better image modeling.
As an art fun rather than a machine learning researcher, I have a question  
**can we model the art work with the generative models?**, and if so, I believe those models should give us 
a different perspective of the art world. 
This is the core motivation of the ***WikiART Face Image*** dataset.  

***WikiART Face Image*** is a dataset of face images from portrait via [WikiART](https://www.wikiart.org/), which is an online visual art encyclopedia.
