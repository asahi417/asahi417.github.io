## Bio
I am a Ph.D student in the [School of Computer Science and Informatics](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/computer-science) at Cardiff University,
co-advised by [Jose-camacho Collados](http://josecamachocollados.com/) and [Steven Schockaert](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/133772-schockaert-steven).
I study natural language processing (NLP), focusing on **language model probing** and 
application of language model in tasks such as **named-entity recognition (NER)** and **question generation (QG)**.
Before joining Cardiff University, I had been a full-time researcher at [Cogent Labs](https://www.cogent.co.jp/en/) from 2018 to 2020. 
In 2021, I did research internships at Amazon supervised by [Danushka Bollegala](https://danushka.net/),
and Snapchat co-supervised by [Francesco Barbieri](https://research.snap.com/team/francesco-barbieri/) and 
[Leonardo Neves](https://research.snap.com/team/leonardo-neves/). 

Aside from NLP, I spend some time on the research of art & machine learning. Also, I love prototyping my random ideas as open-source software.
Please have a look my project page to check those fun works!
