I am a Ph.D student in the [School of Computer Science and Informatics](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/computer-science) at Cardiff University,
co-advised by [Jose-camacho Collados](http://josecamachocollados.com/) and [Steven Schockaert](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/133772-schockaert-steven).
I study natural language processing (NLP), focusing on **language model probing** and 
application of language model in tasks such as 
**named-entity recognition** (eg. [T-NER](https://github.com/asahi417/tner), [TweetNER7](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tner/tweetner7)) 
and **question generation** (eg. [AutoQG](https://asahiushio.com/projects/autoqg)).
I also study NLP on social media, and I am a part of [TweetNLP](https://tweetnlp.org/), where I am developing the core library [`tweetnlp`](https://github.com/cardiffnlp/tweetnlp).

Open Source Projects:
- [***T-NER***](https://github.com/asahi417/tner): A python library to facilitate named-entity-recognition fine-tuning, evaluation, and inference via API.
- [***AutoQG***](https://asahiushio.com/projects/autoqg): Web application to run multi-lingual question generation models.
- [***TweetNLP***](https://github.com/cardiffnlp/tweetnlp): A python library of comprehensive NLP solutions tailored for Twitter.
- [***KEX***](https://pypi.org/project/kex): A python library of modern graph-based keyphrase extraction.

In 2021, I did research internships at Amazon supervised by [Danushka Bollegala](https://danushka.net/),
and Snapchat co-supervised by [Francesco Barbieri](https://research.snap.com/team/francesco-barbieri/), [VÃ­tor Silva Sousa](https://research.snap.com/team/vitor-silva-sousa), and
[Leonardo Neves](https://research.snap.com/team/leonardo-neves/).
Before joining Cardiff University, I had been a full-time research engineer at [Cogent Labs](https://www.cogent.co.jp/en/) from 2018 to 2020.
Aside from NLP, I spend some time on the research of **computational art** ([WikiART Face](https://asahi417.github.io/projects/wikiart_face/)).
