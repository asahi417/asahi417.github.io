I am a Ph.D student in the [School of Computer Science and Informatics](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/computer-science) at Cardiff University,
co-advised by [Jose-camacho Collados](http://josecamachocollados.com/) and [Steven Schockaert](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/133772-schockaert-steven).
I study natural language processing (NLP), focusing on **language model probing** and 
application of language model in tasks such as 
**named-entity recognition (NER)** and **question generation (QG)**.
In 2021, I did research internships at Amazon supervised by [Danushka Bollegala](https://danushka.net/),
and Snapchat co-supervised by [Francesco Barbieri](https://research.snap.com/team/francesco-barbieri/) and 
[Leonardo Neves](https://research.snap.com/team/leonardo-neves/).
Before joining Cardiff University, I had been a full-time research engineer at [Cogent Labs](https://www.cogent.co.jp/en/) from 2018 to 2020.

As part of my research activity, I create web services hosting the models analyzed/proposed in my study    
([***T-NER***](https://asahiushio.com/projects/tner), [***AutoQG***](https://asahiushio.com/projects/autoqg)).
Those apps are all developed by my own (infrastructure, backend, frontend, etc).   
Aside from NLP, I spend some time on the research of **computational art**
([***WikiART Face***](https://asahi417.github.io/projects/wikiart_face/)).
Also, I love prototyping my ideas as open-source software.
Please have a look my [project page](https://asahiushio.com/projects) or [github](https://github.com/asahi417) to check my fun works!
