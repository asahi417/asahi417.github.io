I am a Ph.D student in the [School of Computer Science and Informatics](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/computer-science) at Cardiff University,
co-advised by [Jose-camacho Collados](http://josecamachocollados.com/) and [Steven Schockaert](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/133772-schockaert-steven).
Before joining Cardiff University, I had been a full-time researcher at [Cogent Labs](https://www.cogent.co.jp/en/) from 2018 to 2020. 
In 2021, I did research internships at Amazon supervised by [Danushka Bollegala](https://danushka.net/),
and Snapchat co-supervised by [Francesco Barbieri](https://research.snap.com/team/francesco-barbieri/) and 
[Leonardo Neves](https://research.snap.com/team/leonardo-neves/).
